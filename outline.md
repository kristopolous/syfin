Problem

        People are trying to stay as healthy as they can to live longer. But there's still biological clocks that tick away regardless of what we do. Our telomeres shorten to critical lengths leading to apoptosis and naturally die.

Solution

        You may have heard about the discovery of lipidinoids that can biologically reverse the aging process.

        The number of lipidinoids you have is directly related to your age. The fewer you have, the older you are. 

        These unstable complex molecules are transferrable with some success.

        This means we can for the first time, actually reduce someone's biological age.

Market

        Most wealth is trapped in the older boomer generation who is trying to live as long as possible. A solution

        that reverses their age, at any cost, becomes increasingly tempting as their friends die around them.

        Our early customers are paying $100,000 per month of age reversal and we have a waiting list so long that customers
        are trying to purchase lower numbers on the waiting list from others.

Product

        We have created a lipidinoid transfer machine where you can transfer lipidinoids from one human to another, thus
        exchanging years between them.

        This means you can purchase someone elses youth!

        We provide a two-sided marketplace with a wealthy older supply side and a strap cashed younger demand side.

        Our first Syfin 1.0 was able to make someone 1 week younger for every 10 years of lipdinoids.  Our 2nd version that
        we're in alpha testing can make someone a whole month younger for the same cost.

        We pass those savings on to our customers 

        (laugh)

        I kid I kid, we pass the profits onto you. That's what you're here for.

Traction

        Our test markets are in Salt Lake City, Oklahoma City and Charleston South Carolina - three of the hardest places
        to get an abortion.

        We seek out women with unwanted pregnancies and offer them $200,000 to take the baby to term + all the prenatal costs.

        Then we take the unwanted infant who has approximately 110 years worth of lipidinoids which in v1 we could flip for about
        $275,000 but in v2 this becomes $1,100,000 or $900,000 net per baby.

        We have an app in the marketplace called MySyfin for women who want a gig economy job as child-producers with pay of at least
        $250,000 a year.  

        We've also teamed up with artificial insemination clinics to make the process reliable and easy and we've also teamed up with
        genetics clinics to test how likely a women is to have twins in order for them to do better financial planning.

        Lastly, we are working on futures contracts where women can get a loan up to 8 months out from the delivery date after proof of pregnancy.

Competition

        Our lipidinoid machines are currently patented IP and we have no plans to license them. 

        A post-lipidinoid tranfer recovery time can take up to 96 hours as the biological clocks reverse and a strict regiment of sleep, 
        exercise, and diet is needed in that time.

        This means other more traditional options such as organ transplants, skin grafting, and cosmetic surgery we think will remain 
        popular for the time being.

        Our primary growth market appears to be non-traditional demand.

Financials

        v2 machines are currently $10,000,000 each to manufacture and require a medical specialist that costs about $250,000/year to operate.
        With daily use we estimate a 2 year life-cycle for each machine. 

        All costs in we are at $17,000 per day per installation. We are getting between 2-4 babies per week and so far have been able to use all the lipinoids of every baby before cell degeneration and malignation by careful logistical scheduling.

        After child producer cost this led to 11.7 million gross per annum for v1 and we estimate about $140 million per installation per year with v2.

Amount being raised

        We are looking for $750,000,000 for 75 machines to do a world-wide expansion into wealthy countries with restrictive abortion rules such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Brazil, India, and Singapore.

        There's a 6 month lead time for manufacturing and we will spend that time securing locations and local language specialists as needed.

        We estimate that there will be even a greater supply of babies in these countries given the economic stratification of these countries.
